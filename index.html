        The current system of classification, developed through the contributions of Linnaeus and later refined with Darwin’s theory of evolution, is based on hierarchical categories and evolutionary relationships. This modern system uses binomial nomenclature for uniform naming and organizes organisms based on morphology, anatomy, genetics, and phylogeny. By following it, scientists across the world can communicate without confusion, trace evolutionary lineages, and better understand the connections between different forms of life. It is this precision and universality that makes the modern classification system indispensable in biology today.
