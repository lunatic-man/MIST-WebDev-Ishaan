            Aristotle, often called the "Father of Zoology," was one of the first to attempt a systematic classification of animals. He divided animals into two main groups based on the presence or absence of blood: “blooded” animals (which included vertebrates) and “bloodless” animals (invertebrates). This basic division helped him distinguish major types of animals and laid the foundation for future classification systems.
            <br><br>He also grouped animals according to their habitat, classifying them as land-dwellers, water-dwellers, or air-dwellers. Within these groups, he observed physical features, modes of reproduction, and movement patterns to further categorize them. Although his system was simple and sometimes inaccurate by modern standards, it was a major step toward understanding the diversity of life in a logical way.
