        In ancient India, animals were classified based on their utility, habitat, and behavior, as described in texts like the Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita. Animals were grouped into categories such as domestic animals, which were used for agriculture, transportation, or milk production; wild animals, which lived in forests and often posed danger to humans; and aquatic animals, which lived in rivers, lakes, or oceans. This practical approach helped people understand which animals were useful, which were dangerous, and how they interacted with the environment.</p></div>
    <div class="flex justify-center m-4"><p>Apart from usefulness, ancient Indian scholars also observed habits, diet, and modes of movement to distinguish animals. For example, they noted animals that walked, flew, or swam, and categorized them accordingly. Although this system was not as detailed or scientific as modern classification, it reflected an early attempt to organize the natural world based on observation and human experience, combining both practical knowledge and careful study of living beings.</p></div>
