    <div class="flex justify-center m-4"><p>
        John Ray, a 17th-century naturalist, was one of the first to propose a natural system of classification based on the overall similarities and differences among animals rather than just a single characteristic. He emphasized the importance of reproductive methods and anatomical features in grouping animals, recognizing that species with similar structures and reproductive processes were more closely related. Ray also clearly distinguished major animal groups such as mammals, birds, fishes, and reptiles, laying the groundwork for later, more detailed classification systems.</div>
    <div class="flex justify-center m-4"><p>Unlike earlier systems that focused on habitat or practical use, Rayâ€™s approach aimed to reflect the natural relationships among animals. By observing physical traits and patterns of reproduction, he could group species in a way that made sense biologically, rather than arbitrarily. His work was a significant step toward the modern understanding of taxonomy, influencing later scientists like Linnaeus to develop hierarchical and universal systems of classification.</p></div>
