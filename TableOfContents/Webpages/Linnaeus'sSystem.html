    <div class="flex justify-center m-4"><p>Carl Linnaeus, often called the “Father of Modern Taxonomy,” revolutionized the classification of living organisms in the 18th century. His system, developed in his seminal work Systema Naturae, introduced a hierarchical structure based on observable physical characteristics, which allowed scientists to categorize animals systematically. Linnaeus divided the animal kingdom into broad groups called classes, which were further subdivided into orders, genera, and species. One of his major contributions was the introduction of binomial nomenclature, a two-part naming system for species using Latin names, such as Homo sapiens for humans. This system made identification universal, reducing confusion caused by regional common names.</p></div>
    <div class="flex justify-center m-4"><p>Unlike earlier classifications, which were often arbitrary or based on utility to humans, Linnaeus focused on anatomical similarities. For example, he grouped mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and insects into distinct classes based on shared traits, like body structure, reproductive organs, and modes of movement. While his system had limitations—some groupings were based on superficial features rather than evolutionary relationships—it laid the foundation for modern taxonomy. Linnaeus’ approach emphasized order, consistency, and a global standard, making it a crucial stepping stone toward the evolutionary-based classification systems used today.</p></div>
