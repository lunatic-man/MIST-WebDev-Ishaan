    <p class="para">Classification of animals is essential because of the immense diversity of life on Earth. With millions of species, it would be almost impossible to study, identify, or communicate about them without a structured system. Early methods of classification, like Aristotle’s, were based on simple traits such as habitat or the presence of blood. While these were useful for their time, they were limited and often grouped unrelated organisms together. As science progressed, naturalists realized the need for a more accurate and universal system that could reflect the true nature and diversity of living organisms.
    <br><br>The current system of classification, developed through the contributions of Linnaeus and later refined with Darwin’s theory of evolution, is based on hierarchical categories and evolutionary relationships. This modern system uses binomial nomenclature for uniform naming and organizes organisms based on morphology, anatomy, genetics, and phylogeny. By following it, scientists across the world can communicate without confusion, trace evolutionary lineages, and better understand the connections between different forms of life. It is this precision and universality that makes the modern classification system indispensable in biology today.</p>
